## Description

- The IoT based flood detection with Blynk Integration code allows you to monitor distance measurements of water using an ultrasonic sensor connected to an ESP8266 microcontroller.
- The measured distance in both centimeters and inches is displayed on the Blynk app for real-time visualization. Additionally, LEDs and a buzzer provide visual and audible alerts based on predefined distance conditions.
